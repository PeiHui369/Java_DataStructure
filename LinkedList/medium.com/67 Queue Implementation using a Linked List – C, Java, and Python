A queue is a linear data structure that serves as a collection of elements, 
with three main operations: enqueue, dequeue and peek. 
We have discussed these operations in the previous post and covered an array implementation of a queue data structure. 
In this post, the linked list implementation of a queue is discussed.

A queue can be easily implemented using a linked list. 
In singly linked list implementation, enqueuing happens at the tail of the list, 
and the dequeuing of items happens at the head of the list. 
We need to maintain a pointer to the last node to keep O(1) efficiency for insertion.

Since a doubly linked list offers O(1) insertion and deletion at both ends, 
use it if we want to enqueue to happen at the beginning and dequeuing to occur at the tail of the linked list.


// A Linked List Node
class Node
{
    int data;       // integer data
    Node next;      // pointer to the next node
 
    public Node(int data)
    {
        // set data in the allocated node and return it
        this.data = data;
        this.next = null;
    }
}
 
class Queue
{
    private static Node rear = null, front = null;
    private static int count = 0;
 
    // Utility function to dequeue the front element
    public static int dequeue()     // delete at the beginning
    {
        if (front == null)
        {
            System.out.println("\nQueue Underflow");
            System.exit(-1);
        }
 
        Node temp = front;
        System.out.printf("Removing %d\n", temp.data);
 
        // advance front to the next node
        front = front.next;
 
        // if the list becomes empty
        if (front == null) {
            rear = null;
        }
 
        // decrease the node's count by 1
        count -= 1;
 
        // return the removed item
        return temp.data;
    }
 
    // Utility function to add an item to the queue
    public static void enqueue(int item)     // insertion at the end
    {
        // allocate a new node in a heap
        Node node = new Node(item);
        System.out.printf("Inserting %d\n", item);
 
        // special case: queue was empty
        if (front == null)
        {
            // initialize both front and rear
            front = node;
            rear = node;
        }
        else {
            // update rear
            rear.next = node;
            rear = node;
        }
 
        // increase the node's count by 1
        count += 1;
    }
 
    // Utility function to return the top element in a queue
    public static int peek()
    {
        // check for an empty queue
        if (front == null) {
            System.exit(-1);
        }
 
        return front.data;
    }
 
    // Utility function to check if the queue is empty or not
    public static boolean isEmpty() {
        return rear == null && front == null;
    }
 
    // Function to return the size of the queue
    private static int size() {
        return count;
    }
}
 
class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Queue q = new Queue();
        q.enqueue(1);
        q.enqueue(2);
        q.enqueue(3);
        q.enqueue(4);
 
        System.out.printf("The front element is %d\n", q.peek());
 
        q.dequeue();
        q.dequeue();
        q.dequeue();
        q.dequeue();
 
        if (q.isEmpty()) {
            System.out.println("The queue is empty");
        }
        else {
            System.out.println("The queue is not empty");
        }
    }
}

Output:
 
Inserting 1
Inserting 2
Inserting 3
Inserting 4
The front element is 1
Removing 1
Removing 2
Removing 3
Removing 4
The queue is empty

------------------------------
The advantage of using linked lists over arrays is that it is possible to implement a queue that 
can grow or shrink as much as needed. 
Since each new node will be dynamically allocated, 
overflow is not possible unless heap memory is exhausted. 
Using a static array will restrict the arrayâ€™s maximum capacity, which can lead to queue overflow.
